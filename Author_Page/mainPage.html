        My name is Jorge Luis Ortiz Diaz, JLOrtizDiaz for short. I've been
        writing ever since I can remember. Manifesting stories from thin air and
        having multiple conversations with myself at a time.<br /><br />
        Saying that out-loud sounds much crazier than I actually am... I
        think.<br /><br />
        And, as you can see, I am easily distracted. Not important to the
        subject, I just may lose track at some point. You have been warned. Now
        welcome to my stories.<br />
        I don't consider my stories to be necessarily impactfull, but I do want
        you to understand where they come from. In middle school, I was not a
        popular chap. Being picked on was just a daily challenge that pushed me
        to the utmost edges of my mind. There, I would find peace and solace in
        the stories playing out. Imagine a puppet show, but one where every
        moment changes dynamically and new stories created on the fly.<br />
