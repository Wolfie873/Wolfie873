### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-->This readme is my first attempt at understanding how to use Github and learn coding in general. As of right now I am learning Javascript and have an amateur understanding of HTML and CSS.
If anyone reads this and wants to help on my learning journey by:
<ul>
  <li>Learning together</li>
  <li>Collaborating on ideas</li>
  <li>Mentor me</li>
</ul>
I will be glad for the help. As it stands now I need all the help I can get.Right now I am working on a simple HTML code writer for work and on my free time beefing up my webpage.
On a journey to learn some game design coding, but isn't everyone these days. I just want to share my ideas and do what I love.

My best contact email is jorge.ortiz20@hotmail.com
